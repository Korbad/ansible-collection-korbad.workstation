# config files
kubelet_vars_config_file: /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml #the configuration file for the kubelet itself. It contains settings and options that dictate how the kubelet should run on a particular node. These settings include the container runtime endpoint (e.g., for CRI-O), cgroup driver, cluster DNS, and other kubelet-specific configurations.
# kubelet_env_file: /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.env # This file contains environment variables for the kubelet service. It might be sourced by the kubelet systemd unit file or another configuration file to set environment variables for the kubelet process. This file is not used in all Kubernetes setups but can be present in some configurations. unused by k3s
# kubelet_config_optional: /etc/kubernetes/kubelet-config.yaml # This is an alternative location for the main kubelet configuration file. In some Kubernetes setups, the kubelet configuration might be stored here instead of /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml. The contents and purpose of this file are the same as described for /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml; unused by k3s
kubelet_pki_store: /var/lib/kubelet/pki #  The directory where kubelet stores its certificates and keys, such as the kubelet client certificate and private key. The location of this directory is usually specified in the 10-kubeadm.conf file.
kubelet_kubeconfig_file: /var/lib/kubelet/kubeconfig # The kubeconfig file that contains the kubelet's credentials and connection information for the Kubernetes API server. This file is typically generated by kubeadm and is used by the kubelet to authenticate itself to the API server and access cluster resources.
kubelet_manifests_directory: /etc/kubernetes/manifests # The directory where the kubelet watches for static pod manifests. The kubelet automatically starts, stops, and restarts the pods defined in the manifest files in this directory.
kubelet_base_service_file: /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service # The systemd unit file for the kubelet service. It defines how the kubelet service should start, stop, and run. It may also include additional environment settings and command-line arguments for the kubelet.
kubelet_service_directory: /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d
# kubelet_config_file: /etc/default/kubelet # This file contains environment variables and default settings for the kubelet service. It is usually used in Debian-based systems and is sourced by the kubelet systemd unit file to set default values for environment variables and command-line options. This file can be used to customize the kubelet service settings on Debian-based systems.; unused by k3s
kubelet_service_kubeadm_config_file: "{{ (kubelet_service_directory, '10-kubeadm.conf') | path_join }}" # A configuration file that is created by kubeadm during the initialization process. It contains environment settings and command-line arguments for the kubelet, including the location of the kubelet configuration file, the kubelet certificates directory, and other optional flags.
